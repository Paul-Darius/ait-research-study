The purpose of this software is to detect faces on a database given by the user -database of .avi videos-. The software will create a "Database" directory filled with .jpg images of the detected faces.

Finally, people known as dangerous will be detected in this database. This last part is not created yet.

Installation : chmod+x install.sh ; ./install.sh
Generate Database : chmod +x generate_database.sh; ./generate_database.sh /path/to/database [demo_mode]


-> /path/to/database is either an absolute path to the database or a relative path fromthe current directory

-> demo_mode is an option to decide whether you want to see in live and save in the Database directory a video showing you the database generation or not. If the demo mode is set, the generation will be slower but you will see in a window what the algorithm is doing. If the value is not set or set to 0, the database will be generated without video. If the value is set to any other number, the demo mode is activated.


Then modify the labels of the file "Database/Caffe_Files/full_database.txt" as you want.

Generate Train and Validate caffe files : chmod +x trainandval.sh ;  ./trainandval.sh

The Database directory contains the database of faces sorted by the video.

The Database_Final directory contains the database of faces sorted to create a leveldb or lmdb database which is used with caffe.

N.B.: 
1) This project is going to evolve A LOT. What is in there at the moment (7th february 2016) has probably NO LINK with what it should be in April/May.

2) The database is private and not given there. What those scripts do is to take all the .avi files from a directory called "MBK
