The purpose of this software is to detect faces on a database given by the user -database of .avi videos-. The software will create a "Database" directory filled with .jpg images of the detected faces.

Installation : chmod+x install.sh ; ./install.sh
Generate Database : chmod +x generate_database.sh; /generate_database.sh /path/to/database
